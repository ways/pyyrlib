As I was unable to establish contact with the author of https://gitorious.org/altut-i-python/pyyrlib, I created a copy here.

* Caching; yr.no wants 10 min caching of data.
* Nice errors on wrong URLs (like post codes which doesn't exist.

About
-----

This library provides a simple api for accessing weather data from the Norwegian web site yr.no. At the time being, it is extremely simple.

Example
-------

Import the module:

    >>> import pyyrlib

Search for location:

    >>> pyyrlib.get_location_url('location-name')
    http://url-to-yr.no/xml-data-for-location-name.xml

Get weather data for the found location:

    >>> pyyrlib.returnWeatherData('url-to-yr/location.xml')
    { weatherdata as dictionary }

Simple command line usage:

    bash: pyyrlib.py 'url-ty-yr/location.xml'
    [ acceptably formatted weatherdata in clean text ]

Known issues
------------

- Fragmented and sketchy

Todo
----

- Develop into a real python library
- Connect the search function and stedsnavn.txt
